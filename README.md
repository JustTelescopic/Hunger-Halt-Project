# Hunger-Halt-Project <br>

## This Project is made using ExpressJS and MongoDB .....

Connecting surplus food sources to NGOs and retreat centers is a noble initiative that has the potential to reduce food waste and provide much-needed sustenance to those in need. The food that is wasted at events and functions could be utilized to feed the hungry, and it is essential to make sure that this surplus food reaches the right people efficiently.

One way to achieve this goal is to leverage technology and create an online platform that connects food donors with NGOs and retreat centers in need. This platform could be made accessible to the public, allowing donors to input information about the surplus food they have available and then matching them with the right organizations. By streamlining the donation process, more surplus food can be diverted to those who need it the most.
